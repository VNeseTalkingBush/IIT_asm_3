            As citizens of Vietnam, we understand that our country is still under developing and have to go through various difficulties in order to integrate with the world. Still, we believe that because we are small and young, our country has great opportunities to grow stronger and more advance. Vietnam is on our way to acquire the essence of technology. However, we still lack tools to make this process easier and more efficient. That is the reason why our team decided to create Jeff as a tool, a starter kit for people to get involve into the technology of virtual assistant, letting them experience the convenience of having a system supporting their business and daily life. As a starter kit, Jeff is meant to be the first virtual assistant that people from all ages can use. With simple lines of command and basic functionalities, Jeff will teach the people fundamental concept of virtual assistant and how to interact with them. After the users are familiar enough with Jeff, they would have enough knowledge and experience to move to a higher system to enhance their work even more. <br> <br>
            In the near future, everything will be command by voices and the tasks will be carried out by the robots and AI, it is important that Vietnamese people get involve in this technology from the beginning. We hope that with our humble creation, we would solve the language barrier and closer the technology gap so that Vietnamese citizen can get familiar and enjoy the convenience of a smart system being applied to their daily life and/or business.

                  <p class="card-text">Our goal with Jeff is to make it easy to use and users friendly, so we would design it as simple as possible. The user interface will be minimal with only Jeff avatar, chat box between users and Jeff, and a button to input voice command. Jeff’s will appear on the small corner when he is activated. When not in used, Jeff will enter sleep mode, which means it would still be working under the background and will response immediately upon calling. The users experience would also be a crucial goal for us when developing Jeff. We tried our best to create Jeff simple from inside to outside. Jeff’s source code was written very simple so that he has faster response time but still guarantee the accuracy of the result. We believe this would give the users great users experience.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">To keep the program simple and users friendly, the teams has put a lot of work in thinking about command lines. We had to think of the variety of commands that users would use since different tasks means different commands, while at the same time, commands format has to be uniformity so that Jeff can recognize the commands and carry out the tasks. In the end, our team has planned, unified and developed a unique set of commands that is both easy for the users to learn and remember as well as having a solid format so that the system can recognize them.</p>

We have programmed Jeff in a way that he would only do basic tasks such as searching with internet, playing music and other fundamental tasks and because of this reason, Jeff does not have to process a lot, all it has to do is browsing through the data source and find the most relevant results. We will also set Jeff’s default browser as google.com so that the accuracy of the results will be guaranteed.</p>

              <h5>Initial idea</h5>
              <p>
                At the beginning of the project, each member of the team had different project ideas because assignment 1 was individual. However, assignment 2 required us to create a team and work together on a project so the team had to choose out 1 idea among the member. At the time, each of us had ideas but it was very unclear. Among all, Quy’s idea proposal was very outstanding. He had a very clear thought about creating AI and how to build it. So, at first, our goal was to create an AI virtual assistant which is capable machine learning. In order to do that, we had to find the relevant source code for the AI part of the assistant and another source code for machine learning. After that, we had to think of a way to inject these two into the system combining so that they work fine together. That was a fairly challenging tasks that we managed to do. However, the biggest and most challenging problem arise when we almost done with building a workable code was that in order for the AI and machine learning systems to work properly, we need huge amount of users data so that the machine have some sort of data that it can learn at the beginning. This made us realize how small and unskilled we are and the fact that we are just freshmen in the IT fields, this project seems to be way to overwhelmed for us to carry out.

              <h5>Current idea</h5>
              <p>
                As the project keep on going, we had to think of new idea that we can actually carry out because we believe that is the real reason behind this project. It is not important how complicated the project is, it is how we think and create the project. So, after a few meetings, we decided to simplify our initial goal. Although our plan still remains creating a virtual assistant that is meant for Vietnamese people, the path we choose is very much different from the beginning. We began to think of how users in Vietnam use virtual assistant that is include on their smart device and we realized that, most of the users, including us does not find the virtual assistant feature helpful. It is not because these virtual assistants are useless or failures, but we just don’t have the need for using it. Rather than speaking in English and waiting for the system to response according to the internet speed, sometimes the results are not even close, we can just search manually by typing a scrolling. With this concept in mind, we believe it is crucial to have a system that is both easy to use, friendly with Vietnamese people and can act as a way for people to get familiar with the technology. That is when our idea of Jeff started to actualize.

              <h5>Future plan</h5>
              <p>
                In order to keep Jeff simple and easy to use as well as users friendly, we had to remove a lot of advance feature that is normally considered valuable on others virtual assistant. For example, we had to remove AI and machine learning features to simplify Jeff developing phase and we had to limit Jeff’s functions so that it remains users friendly and easy to use. If Jeff is approved and invested in the future when we graduated and become professional IT, we could create an upgrade version of Jeff, maybe we will call it “Jeff+” or “Jeff pro max” which we will add these features and upgrade Jeff’s overall UI/UX as well as the back-end code for a smoother experience. But at the time, our goal with Jeff is still simple and will follow the current plan.

            Working as a reporter, Duc’s job is to plan out the content, do research and write the report for the whole project. He would need to paln out the idea with Giang, the web developer to create such content that would fit both formats. <br> <br>
            Thang is in charge of developing the overall appearance for the project. He also required to collaborate with Quy, the back-end developer to create the user experience for Jeff. He would also need to update Jeff if Quy found a bug and debugged it.

                      <p>During this project, our choice of programming language was Python since Python has many advantages such as simple commands, fast and powerful, huge community and library. In order to exploit Python potentials, we decided to use Pycharm, which is an IDE for Python developers. This software however, required the users to pay for it if they wanted to use the full features. However, lucky for us, RMIT university was generous enough to grand all IT student access to the school Pycharm service so we did not have to pay for the software but can still enjoy such a powerful tool.</p>

                      <p>Any projects need a repository in order to save and keep track of the overall developing process of the project. We decide to use Github because it is the most common repository available. Github has many advantages to offer to their users. It is free and the storing amount is more than enough for us to store our data. Rather than storing on a personal device, Github allow us to use the miracle of internet. Users just need to push their work on to their server, the server will store it on their cloud systems with the level of information security depends on how users set it to be opened source or closed source.</p>

First of all, TKinter is simple to learn and use, it is the standard GUI of Python and we wanted to keep Jeff simple so TKinter is both simple and compatible with Python - our choice of programming language during the development of Jeff. Secondly, TKinter was included upon installing Python so we did not have to download anything</p>

VScode was exactly what she needed because it is free to install, after installation, the users can used most of the available features that VScode offers. VScode also has huge community, thus, there many plugins to install and make her job easier. VScode overall interface is simple yet convenient and display necessary features to users. It is easy to use while learning.</p>

        <p>Testing is a crucial step for us before releasing the final product. We will first ask our friends and family to try out the initial products. They will try using the virtual assistant for a short period of time then report to us any problems such as bugs or misbehave functions. We will fix these issues then gather a testing group for further errors scouting. Finally, we will release the demo version to the public. Users from many places will give us their feedback on our products, we can then use these feedbacks to enhance our product gradually. After all the trials and demo are finished, it will be time for the official release of our virtual assistant.</p>

        <h1>Risks</h1>
        <p>There is no denying that nothing is perfect and easy to do according to the plan set out. It can be said that when we started the project, we encountered many difficulties as well as possible risks. Our idea is to create a virtual assistant application to interact with users and will help users to solve their requests easily. This project requires us to have a good understanding and solid knowledge of programming. We decided to choose Python for this project because Python is a very popular programming language. </p>

              <div class="card-body">
                <p class="card-text">The first risk we ran into was about the back-end code. In fact, there are a lot of open-source codes about virtual assistants shared on programming forums. However, the shared knowledge is quite extensive and professional, we have to learn a lot to be able to understand the algorithms well. The worry is that since we don't have much experience with back-end coding, our code may not be optimized and there will be a lot of out-of-control errors.</p>

              <div class="card-body">
                <p class="card-text"> We also encountered several problems while designing the interface for our product. Actually, before doing this project, we didn't have any knowledge about UX/UI programming for the app. After a while of researching, we decided to use Tkinter library of Python to design a simple interface. However, due to our lack of knowledge of interface programming, this was also a big challenge for us. </p>

                  It is obvious that encountering bugs when coding is inevitable. This can slow down our workflow. Actually, finding and fixing bugs took a lot of time for us. And timing can also be seen as one of the biggest risks that can happen with this project of ours. Since we only had 1 month to work on this project, it can be said to be very difficult to complete the product properly.  <br><br>
                  The time limit is probably the biggest obstacle for us. While implementing the project, we almost did not have a solid knowledge to proceed, so learning while doing is a common occurrence. and with limited time, perfect project completion is impossible. <br><br>
                  We did our best, but the risks such as code errors, code not running as expected, ... will all make our work stagnate. However, up to this point, we have also solved many of the above problems and can say that our product is partially complete.

              Since the beginning of this code was conducted online, we contacted each other via Facebook to introduce ourselves and get to know each other first. Since Giang, Quy, Thang has been working together since the last semester, it was no problem for them to communicate to each other. However, Duc is a new member so communication could be hard for him at first. However, he proved to be fairly sociable and did not have any problems with communicating. After getting to know each other on Facebook, we had to decide a workplace since not every information, data and files can be transmitted via Facebook messenger. We decide to use Discord as our main platform since it is very convenient and smart, by using Discord, we can devide chat rooms into individual sections for different types of files. For example, team rules can be put into “Welcomes and Rules” chatbox, general information can go in to “General”. Because of this, our tasks were display clearly so it was carried out very quick. We set a fixed 1-hour meeting on Friday every week to keep track on the process of tasks given to each member. To ensure the work are finished upon deadlines, Quy – the teamleader would reminds the members their tasks at the middle of the week, on Wednesday. If for some reason, a member is absent during that week meeting session, he/she must inform the group before hands and submit their finished tasks on the Discord dedicated chatbox for the team to look through later in the meeting session. If there are any issue, the leader would report back to that teammates and that teammates must finish it as soon as possible. We do not have a specific workload devisor or mechanism. Each member was given a task, we tried our best to finish it as soon as possible. Anyone who finished first and still have spare time, they can either focus of the other enrolled subjects or they could choose to help other members. Because we believe in each other responsibility, we give each other freedom at work and spare time for other subjects because we understand that different members have different subjects.
