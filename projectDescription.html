          <h3>Aims</h3>
          <p class="text">
            As citizens of Vietnam, we understand that our country is still under developing and have to go through various difficulties in order to integrate with the world. Still, we believe that because we are small and young, our country has great opportunities to grow stronger and more advance. Vietnam is on our way to acquire the essence of technology. However, we still lack tools to make this process easier and more efficient. That is the reason why our team decided to create Jeff as a tool, a starter kit for people to get involve into the technology of virtual assistant, letting them experience the convenience of having a system supporting their business and daily life. As a starter kit, Jeff is meant to be the first virtual assistant that people from all ages can use. With simple lines of command and basic functionalities, Jeff will teach the people fundamental concept of virtual assistant and how to interact with them. After the users are familiar enough with Jeff, they would have enough knowledge and experience to move to a higher system to enhance their work even more. <br> <br>
            In the near future, everything will be command by voices and the tasks will be carried out by the robots and AI, it is important that Vietnamese people get involve in this technology from the beginning. We hope that with our humble creation, we would solve the language barrier and closer the technology gap so that Vietnamese citizen can get familiar and enjoy the convenience of a smart system being applied to their daily life and/or business.

                  <p class="card-text">Our goal with Jeff is to make it easy to use and users friendly, so we would design it as simple as possible. The user interface will be minimal with only Jeff avatar, chat box between users and Jeff, and a button to input voice command. Jeff’s will appear on the small corner when he is activated. When not in used, Jeff will enter sleep mode, which means it would still be working under the background and will response immediately upon calling. The users experience would also be a crucial goal for us when developing Jeff. We tried our best to create Jeff simple from inside to outside. Jeff’s source code was written very simple so that he has faster response time but still guarantee the accuracy of the result. We believe this would give the users great users experience.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">To keep the program simple and users friendly, the teams has put a lot of work in thinking about command lines. We had to think of the variety of commands that users would use since different tasks means different commands, while at the same time, commands format has to be uniformity so that Jeff can recognize the commands and carry out the tasks. In the end, our team has planned, unified and developed a unique set of commands that is both easy for the users to learn and remember as well as having a solid format so that the system can recognize them.</p>

We have programmed Jeff in a way that he would only do basic tasks such as searching with internet, playing music and other fundamental tasks and because of this reason, Jeff does not have to process a lot, all it has to do is browsing through the data source and find the most relevant results. We will also set Jeff’s default browser as google.com so that the accuracy of the results will be guaranteed.</p>

              <h5>Initial idea</h5>
              <p>
                At the beginning of the project, each member of the team had different project ideas because assignment 1 was individual. However, assignment 2 required us to create a team and work together on a project so the team had to choose out 1 idea among the member. At the time, each of us had ideas but it was very unclear. Among all, Quy’s idea proposal was very outstanding. He had a very clear thought about creating AI and how to build it. So, at first, our goal was to create an AI virtual assistant which is capable machine learning. In order to do that, we had to find the relevant source code for the AI part of the assistant and another source code for machine learning. After that, we had to think of a way to inject these two into the system combining so that they work fine together. That was a fairly challenging tasks that we managed to do. However, the biggest and most challenging problem arise when we almost done with building a workable code was that in order for the AI and machine learning systems to work properly, we need huge amount of users data so that the machine have some sort of data that it can learn at the beginning. This made us realize how small and unskilled we are and the fact that we are just freshmen in the IT fields, this project seems to be way to overwhelmed for us to carry out.

              <h5>Current idea</h5>
              <p>
                As the project keep on going, we had to think of new idea that we can actually carry out because we believe that is the real reason behind this project. It is not important how complicated the project is, it is how we think and create the project. So, after a few meetings, we decided to simplify our initial goal. Although our plan still remains creating a virtual assistant that is meant for Vietnamese people, the path we choose is very much different from the beginning. We began to think of how users in Vietnam use virtual assistant that is include on their smart device and we realized that, most of the users, including us does not find the virtual assistant feature helpful. It is not because these virtual assistants are useless or failures, but we just don’t have the need for using it. Rather than speaking in English and waiting for the system to response according to the internet speed, sometimes the results are not even close, we can just search manually by typing a scrolling. With this concept in mind, we believe it is crucial to have a system that is both easy to use, friendly with Vietnamese people and can act as a way for people to get familiar with the technology. That is when our idea of Jeff started to actualize.

              <h5>Future plan</h5>
              <p>
                In order to keep Jeff simple and easy to use as well as users friendly, we had to remove a lot of advance feature that is normally considered valuable on others virtual assistant. For example, we had to remove AI and machine learning features to simplify Jeff developing phase and we had to limit Jeff’s functions so that it remains users friendly and easy to use. If Jeff is approved and invested in the future when we graduated and become professional IT, we could create an upgrade version of Jeff, maybe we will call it “Jeff+” or “Jeff pro max” which we will add these features and upgrade Jeff’s overall UI/UX as well as the back-end code for a smoother experience. But at the time, our goal with Jeff is still simple and will follow the current plan.
