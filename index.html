                Our team decided to go with the name Skynet. The reason behind
                this is because our project is to create an AI-machine learning
                virtual assistant. We believe that AI will be the technology
                that will dominate the industry in the near future. As
                developers, we wish to be the pioneers of this field. In pop
                culture, there is this popular movie where a tech company
                created an AI that is so smart and advance that it can calculate
                then travel time to terminate anything that is a threat to the
                future. That movie was Terminator and the name of the company is
                Skynet. We thought to ourselves, what better name can we choose
                for this group other than Skynet.

                    “I was born and raised in Hanoi. Ever since I was a child, I
                    have been remarked to be extremely curious. I often hide
                    adults from taking apart electronics in the house to find
                    out how they work inside and then putting them back
                    together. When I was a little older, I was exposed to a
                    computer and was immediately captivated by what it could do
                    especially with video games where I could interact with
                    non-player characters. One day, I was watching a robot
                    cartoon called Wall-E, once again my passion for technology
                    was aroused, at that time I wished when I grew up, I could
                    create a robot with a conscious and perception as a human
                    being. After 2 years of studying, I realized that was not
                    really the major I wanted to pursue. I suddenly realized
                    that what I want to create is not a robot, but the brain of
                    that robot. In order to achieve that goal of mine, I decided
                    to study information technology to learn how humans can
                    teach computers and how computers interact with humans.”

                  <p>
                    “I was born and grown up in Ho Chi Minh City. During my time
                    in Secondary Highschool, I had a chance to experience Pascal
                    Programming. From there, I realize that information
                    technology is a powerful tool that can solve many math
                    problems with just some simple lines of code. Ever since I
                    know about gaming and web surfing, I have always wondered
                    how they are programmed. I wanted to program games,
                    application as well as websites for myself so I decided to
                    study IT. Personally, I have taken a Front-end course
                    therefore I have some experience in Java Script and CSS to
                    create basic websites base on my knowledge of designing and
                    programming. However, my back-end development skill is still
                    not sharpened so I have a lot to learn. Additionally, I am
                    taking a French course which I think might be useful for my
                    future career. Beside from that, playing guitar for me is an
                    excellent way to relief the stress after a long period of
                    studying and cooking for the family is another passion of
                    mine. Moreover, in order to achieve my goal of being a
                    professional game/web developer, I have a habit of reading
                    books about life and developing skills as a way of
                    self-development”.

                  <p>
                    “Similar to our front-end developer, am also born and raised
                    in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. However, I come from a mixed
                    culture family because my ancestors were from China. Being
                    born in a strict Chinese family, I have developed a sense of
                    responsibility and hard-working attitude toward my goals.
                    But I love playing games, it just every boys passion. Back
                    in the days, my cousin, who has been a specialist in IT for
                    several years now, usually came to my house and showed me
                    some hacking tricks for the game, he even helped me cracked
                    the wifi passwords of local neighbors, which was very cool.
                    I then thought to myself, IT was so astonishing and have so
                    many potentials in the future, so I developed the passion
                    ever since. I still have long way to go since I just
                    finished learning about the basic concepts in IT, but I am
                    eager to learn more. During school times, I am focused and
                    determined but in my free time, I enjoy doing various sport
                    activities as way to keep my head cool and my body strong. I
                    also enjoy reading new research papers to update my
                    knowledge on things happening around the world and what new
                    technology that should be minded in order to keep up the
                    trend.”

                    “I was born in a small village in Hai Duong, Vietnam. After
                    graduation in high school, I went to Ho Chi Minh City for
                    studying in the university. In IT field, I am really
                    interested in programming which is about building games.
                    When I was in Highschool, I used to change values in games
                    data so that the money would increase, which were really fun
                    experiences for me so I developed an interest for IT since.
                    I have had basic knowledge about Python and had tried
                    creating my own games, but they are still under development
                    and I still have a long way to go. In my free time, I often
                    do part-time jobs, social activities and enjoy my time at
                    the Taekwondo club as well as playing the guitar to relief
                    school stress. For example, I took part in an outside
                    bonding with my club which is Taekwondo. One time, we even
                    went climbing with the whole club. It was a memorable day
                    for me because we try so hard. In the end, we managed to get
                    to the top. The feeling was very proud and relief because I
                    had finally achieved the goal of that day. One day, I will
                    reach the peak of my dream and become a great game
                    developer.”

              For some people, time is as value as gold. There is too much work to
              do while time is limited. Hiring an assistant seems to be an amazing
              way to share the workload and boosts productivity. However, it is
              not easy for an employer to find the perfect assistant who can keep
              up with the workflow while at the same time, understanding the
              employer’s need and still able to maintain productivity. Not to
              mention, hiring an assistant also means the employer has to pay them
              salary like any other employees. In today world, when technology
              gradually replace human in many fields, virtual assistant is a new
              way for the busy businessmen to keep track on their work as well as
              function like any other real assistant. Despite that, virtual
              assistant seems to be a new and strange concept for the people of
              Vietnam, many claims that they are not familiar with the technology
              and does not know the supported language to interact with the
              assistant. Understanding these difficulties, in this project our
              team challenged ourselves to create a virtual assistant that can
              solve these issues. <br /> <br>
              Most available assistant today, such as Cortana or Siri operates on
              a very high level of technology, too advanced that many users cannot
              understand the concept and the functions of it. What we did with
              Jeff was removing all the unfriendly functions of other virtual
              assistant and give him basic functions and commands so that newbies
              to technology would understand and can use Jeff as their first step
              to get familiar with the concept of virtual assistant. Jeff is
              capable of basic tasks such as searching with voice input, schedule
              and remind the users for the meetings, calls as well as texting,
              creates timers, etc. All of these functions can be operated by voice
              command and the supported language will be Vietnamese. We hope that
              Jeff can be the first step for Vietnamese people to get familiar
              with applying technology to their daily life. After getting familiar
              with Jeff, the users would have knowledge to upgrade his/her
              assistant to a more advance system according to their needs. Of
              course, there are still many rooms for Jeff to get improved and
              enhanced. However, the nature of Jeff will still remain a basic
              virtual assistant that functions fundamentally and act as the first
              steps to get into the vast world of technology.
            </p>

            <h3 class="motivation">Motivation</h3>
            <p class="motivation-text">We noticed a fact that when people around the world are adapting to the rapid change of the technology world, the Vietnamese still struggle to get familiar with 4.0 technologies. Voice assistant is not a new concept, in fact, the first virtual assistant was introduced in the early 90s by IBM and it was called “Simon”. It was not until October 2011 that Apple commercialize Sire – the first advanced and commercially used virtual assistant. Since then, people around the world have been adapting with this technology and apply it to better their daily life. Despite there are many advanced voice assistants available with AI and self-learning technology, most Vietnamese people forget that they exist on their smart devices. This is because these assistants are not capable of Vietnamese language and is not fully optimized for local information and localization. <br><br>
              Understand these issues and wish to create a product that is “by Vietnamese and for Vietnamese”, we have this idea of creating Jeff – a Vietnamese friendly virtual assistant to solve these issues. We create Jeff with the purpose of creating a convenient, smart and friendly way for users to interact with their device. Not only that, we build Jeff as basic and easy to use as possible because we want Jeff to be peoples’ first virtual assistant and Jeff would act as a means for them to get familiar with the concept of virtual assistant before the move on to more advance system. Especially, when the pandemic is happening and people have to work from home, Jeff can be a good way for people to boost their productivity and enhance their work from home experience.
            </p>

            <h3 class="landscape">Landscape</h3>
            <p class="landscape-text">In fact, we are not the first group of people to think of this idea. There are a few honorable names that is worth mentioning but the biggest competitors are the virtual assistant called KiKi developed by VNG and Viettel Cyberbot developed by Viettel. Both of these companies are big giants when it comes to the technology field in Vietnam. However, what make Jeff distinguished from these 2 is the fact that Jeff was built for basics usage. Which means that Jeff will so easy to use since he only has the basic functions such as searching, planning schedule, set timer, etc. These functions will be activated with basic command lines that will be short and easy to learn. Jeff is different from the rest because he is not meant to be advance and capable of intelligent tasks, Jeff is meant to be basic and easy to use so that users get familiar with the technology and can move on to higher system when they feel they are ready.</p>

But at the time, our goal with Jeff is still simple and will follow the current plan.
