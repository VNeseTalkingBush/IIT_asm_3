We believe that AI will be the technology that will dominate the industry in the near future. As developers, we wish to be the pioneers of this field. In pop culture, there is this popular movie where a tech company created an AI that is so smart and advance that it can calculate then travel time to terminate anything that is a threat to the future. That movie was Terminator and the name of the company is Skynet. We thought to ourselves, what better name can we choose for this group other than Skynet.</p>

                <p>
                  “I was born and raised in Hanoi. Ever since I was a child, I have been remarked to be extremely curious. I often hide adults from taking apart electronics in the house to find out how they work inside and then putting them back together. When I was a little older, I was exposed to a computer and was immediately captivated by what it could do especially with video games where I could interact with non-player characters. One day, I was watching a robot cartoon called Wall-E, once again my passion for technology was aroused, at that time I wished when I grew up, I could create a robot with a conscious and perception as a human being. After 2 years of studying, I realized that was not really the major I wanted to pursue. I suddenly realized that what I want to create is not a robot, but the brain of that robot. In order to achieve that goal of mine, I decided to study information technology to learn how humans can teach computers and how computers interact with humans.”

                <p>
                  “I was born and grown up in Ho Chi Minh City. During my time in Secondary Highschool, I had a chance to experience Pascal Programming. From there, I realize that information technology is a powerful tool that can solve many math problems with just some simple lines of code. Ever since I know about gaming and web surfing, I have always wondered how they are programmed.  I wanted to program games, application as well as websites for myself so I decided to study IT. Personally, I have taken a Front-end course therefore I have some experience in Java Script and CSS to create basic websites base on my knowledge of designing and programming. However, my back-end development skill is still not sharpened so I have a lot to learn. Additionally, I am taking a French course which I think might be useful for my future career. Beside from that, playing guitar for me is an excellent way to relief the stress after a long period of studying and cooking for the family is another passion of mine. Moreover, in order to achieve my goal of being a professional game/web developer, I have a habit of reading books about life and developing skills as a way of self-development”.

                  “Similar to our front-end developer, am also born and raised in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. However, I come from a mixed culture family because my ancestors were from China. Being born in a strict Chinese family, I have developed a sense of responsibility and hard-working attitude toward my goals. But I love playing games, it just every boys passion. Back in the days, my cousin, who has been a specialist in IT for several years now, usually came to my house and showed me some hacking tricks for the game, he even helped me cracked the wifi passwords of local neighbors, which was very cool. I then thought to myself, IT was so astonishing and have so many potentials in the future, so I developed the passion ever since. I still have long way to go since I just finished learning about the basic concepts in IT, but I am eager to learn more. During school times, I am focused and determined but in my free time, I enjoy doing various sport activities as way to keep my head cool and my body strong. I also enjoy reading new research papers to update my knowledge on things happening around the world and what new technology that should be minded in order to keep up the trend.”

                  “I was born in a small village in Hai Duong, Vietnam.  After graduation in high school, I went to Ho Chi Minh City for studying in the university. In IT field, I am really interested in programming which is about building games. When I was in Highschool, I used to change values in games data so that the money would increase, which were really fun experiences for me so I developed an interest for IT since. I have had basic knowledge about Python and had tried creating my own games, but they are still under development and I still have a long way to go. In my free time, I often do part-time jobs, social activities and enjoy my time at the Taekwondo club as well as playing the guitar to relief school stress. For example, I took part in an outside bonding with my club which is Taekwondo. One time, we even went climbing with the whole club. It was a memorable day for me because we try so hard.  In the end, we managed to get to the top. The feeling was very proud and relief because I had finally achieved the goal of that day. One day, I will reach the peak of my dream and become a great game developer.”
